## Distributed Computing with CPU  

** POST UNDER CONSTRUCTION **

CC hosts around 100 low-end SL machines. Since they are conected to the common NTFS server, it is easy to setup distributed compute on the shared memory and several machines.<br/>

If your task can be parallelized on CPUs, you should consider this. You may create an ssh cluster with the sl2 lab machines. Hostnames of sl2 machines are `sl2-<num>.cse.iitb.ac.in` e.g. `sl2-58.cse.iitb.ac.in` where `num` spans the range `[1-110]` almost wholly. 

Here is a script to check which machines are switched on:
```

```

Here is sample script to execute jobs on these machines:
