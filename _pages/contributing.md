## Folder Layout
All content is in markdown (.md) files. Following is a useful resource for markdown: [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Following are useful folders:
* \_posts/ : contains all post .md files
* \_pages/ : contains all page .md files

**Posts** will be the main source of our shared knowledge. This is what you should generally create or edit.

**Pages** will generally contain meta information about the wiki. The landing page will contain helpful links to get started. 

Please read this short guide for creating and managing posts: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) . Some of that information is also provided below to get you started.

## Editing a post

Edit the markdown file corresponding to a post. For example, to edit the post [CC Facilities](https://cse-iitb-wiki.github.io/cc-facilities/), you should edit the file 

```
_posts/2020-09-13-cc-facilities.md
```

Pages can be edited on github itself. Look for the edit button when browsing the file on github repository:

## Creating a post

Create a file in the \_posts directory in the following format
```
_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md
```
This will appear at the following URL:
```
https://cse-iitb-wiki.github.io/post-title
```

Pages can be created on github itself - you don't need to install git. Look for "Add File" while browsing the `_posts/` folder. For example:

## Creating a page
Same as creating a post, except it must be added to `_pages/` folder.

## Adding a page to the nav bar
TBD

## Using Latex commands in markdown

Example latex:
```
$$x^2 + y^2 = 42$$
```
Renders as:

$$x^2 + y^2 = 42$$

<!-- Github by default does not support latex/math. However, there is a workaround as mentioned in [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53981118/).

## Adding images/screenshots
